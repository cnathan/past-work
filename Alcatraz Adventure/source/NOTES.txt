Removed the following code, felt it wasn't needed.
It should work ok, but I think it makes the gameplay awkward and could may cause problems.
Block reference currently disabled variable "dropItem" of type char

line = 683
[code]
		if(treasureList.size()>=5)
		{
			SetConsoleTextAttribute(GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE), 78);
			cout << " You have too many items\nWould you like to drop an item? (Y/N)" << endl << ">";
			cin>>dropItem;
			SetConsoleTextAttribute(GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE), 15);

			tolower(dropItem);
			system("cls");

			/* Players may not choose which item they wish to drop */
			if(dropItem=='y')
			{
				treasureList.pop_back();
			}
			else
			{
				cout<<" You decide not to drop an item "<<endl;
			}
		}
